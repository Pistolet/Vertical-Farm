## Chapter 1. Remodeling Nature

### Daniel Defoe, A Journal of the Plagur Years by a Citizen Who All the while continued to live in London
<p>
A Journal of the Plague Year
A novel often read as non-fiction, this is an account of the Great Plague of London in 1665. It is undersigned by the initials "H. F.", suggesting the author's uncle Henry Foe as a primary source. It is an historical account of the events based on extensive research, published in 1722.

Bring out your dead! The ceaseless chant of doom echoed through a city of emptied streets and filled grave pits. For this was London in the year of 1665, the Year of the Great Plague … In 1721, when the Black Death again threatened the European Continent, Daniel Defoe wrote "A Journal of the Plague Year" to alert an indifferent populace to the horror that was almost upon them. Through the eyes of a saddler who had chosen to remain while multitudes fled, the master realist vividly depicted a plague-stricken city. He re-enacted the terror of a helpless people caught in a tragedy they could not comprehend: the weak preying on the dying, the strong administering to the sick, the sinful orgies of the cynical, the quiet faith of the pious. With dramatic insight he captured for all time the death throes of a great city.

### James Lovelock, The Age of Gaia
<p>
가이아 이론( - 理論, 영어: Gaia hypothesis, Gaia theory, Gaia principle)은 영국의 과학자 제임스 러브록이 주장한 가설로, 1972년의 짧은 논문 〈대기권 분석을 통해 본 가이아 연구〉에 이어[1] 1978년 저서 《지구상의 생명을 보는 새로운 관점》을 통해 소개되었다.

가이아(Gaia)란 고대 그리스인들이 대지의 여신을 부른 이름으로서, 지구를 은유적으로 나타낸 말이다. 이것에 착안해서 러브록은 지구와 지구에 살고 있는 생물, 대기권, 대양, 토양까지를 포함하는 신성하고 지성적인 즉, 능동적이고 살아 있는 지구를 가리키는 존재로 가이아를 사용했다. 가이아 이론은 지구를 단순히 기체에 둘러싸인 암석덩이로 생명체를 지탱해주기만 하는 것이 아니라 생물과 무생물이 상호작용하면서 스스로 진화하고 변화해 나가는 하나의 생명체이자 유기체임을 강조한다.

가이아 이론은 하나의 가설에 불과하지만 지구온난화 현상과 최근의 지구환경 문제와 관련해 새롭게 주목받았으며, 환경주의와 관련해서는 끊임없이 인용되고 있다.

하지만 리처드 도킨스를 비롯한 주류 생물학계에서는 냉담하게 반응한다. 도킨스는 자연선택은 이기성과 맹목성에 이끌려서 진행된다면서 강력하게 반박했고, 《풀리는 무지개》에서 러브록과 마굴리스를 ‘나쁜 시적 과학’의 예시 중 하나로 비판했다.

번역본 : 요람에서 요람으로
</pre>
<p>
환경과 산업이 대립된다는 인식이 팽배하다.
산업혁명기의 디자인(요람에서 무덤으로 모델) 이 제조업을 지배하고 있다.
저자들이 제시하는 새로운 디자인(생태적 효과성)
- 소비하는 것보다 더 많은 에너지를 만들어내고, 소모하는 물을 스스로 정화시키는, 마치 나무와 같은 건물을 짓자.
- 방출하는 폐수가 너무 맑고 깨끗해 식수로 사용할 수 있는 공장을 세우자.
- 다 사용하고 나면 쓸모 없는 폐기물이 되는 것이 아니라, 땅에서 잘 썩어 동식물의 먹이나 토양의 영양소가 되는 제품을 만들자. 또는 다시 산업계의 순환을 따라 새로운 제품을 만들 수 있는 고품질의 재료로 다시 탄생할 수 있는 제품을 만들자.
- 매년 인간과 자연을 위해 수억, 수조 달러의 가치를 재생산해내는 원료를 개발하자.
- 재화와 서비스 전달 과정에서 삶의 질을 고양시켜줄 수 있는 교통체계를 수립하자.
- 자원은 한정적이고 쓰레기와 오염 물질이 넘치는 세상이 아니라 즐거움이 넘치는 세상을 만들자.

요람에서 요람으로 라는 자연의 시스템은 폐기물이라는 개념이 존재하지 않음.

### McHarg, Design with Nature

<p>
Since the early 1970s, Ian McHarg’s design-with-nature concept has been inspiring landscape architects, community and regional planners, and liked-minded professionals to create designs that take advantage of ecosystem services and promote environmental and public health. This study bridges the gap in the literature that has resulted from a lack of empirical examinations on the multiple performance benefits derived through design-with-nature and the under-investigated social aspect emanated from McHarg’s Ecological Determinism design approach. The Woodlands, TX, USA, an ecologically designed community development under McHarg’s approach, is compared with two adjacent communities that follow the conventional design approach. Using national environmental databases and multiple-year residents’ survey information, this study assesses three landscape performance metrics of McHarg’s approach: stormwater runoff, urban heat island effect, and social acceptance. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) was used to assess the development extent and land surface temperature distribution. Results show that McHarg’s approach demonstrates benefits in reducing runoff and urban heat island effect, whereas it confronts challenges with the general acceptance of manicured landscapes and thus results in a low safety perception level when residents interact with naturally designed landscapes. The authors argue that design-with-nature warrants multifunctionality because of its intrinsic interdisciplinary approach. Moreover, education and dissemination of successful examples can achieve a greater level of awareness among the public and further promote multifunctional design for landscape sustainability.

## Chapter 3. Today's Agriculture
<p>
21세기 농업의 기원 : 미국 남북 전쟁, 석유 발견, 내연 기관의 개발 및 다이나마이트의 발명
<br>
The Civil War was a fight to the finish over the right to control what happened to the country’s cotton crop, the South’s main agricultural product. ... New England–based textile and clothing manufacturers wanted unlimited access to the gin-milled cotton and wanted it on their own terms, while the Southern cotton growers wanted the best price for their harvest, no matter who bought it. Conflict ensued, big time. The South ended up selling most of its cotton production to Europe at substantially higher prices than the Northern industrialists could or would agree to pay. In either case, the Yankees reacted quite negatively to Dixie entrepreneurship. For the Southern plantation owners, labor was dirt cheap, enabling them to achieve outrageous returns on their harvests. That’s because they relied on slaves brought over mainly from West Africa as their primary labor force, although indentured white farmworkers were plentiful, too. Besides providing a reliable work force, slaves from West Africa did one other thing that would eventually bring about another remarkable change to the New World: They introduced hookworm parasites into American soil. As the savagely fought conflict progressed year after year, army recruiters began to feel an increasing lack of support throughout most of the North. A rallying slogan was what was called for.
<br>
...
<br>
If the South was ever to rise again as an agricultural force to be dealt with (and rise it did), then a new way of farming had to be invented. Enter the discovery of oil and the development of the internal-combustion combustion engine. A political battle for economic supremacy became the singular event that eventually forced Southern landowners to switch to mechanized farming equipment, replacing human labor with gas-guzzling clunkers. It would be the machines, and the many agricultural innovations that took advantage of them, that helped define the second great agricultural revolution.
<br>
...
<br>
It rapidly became the explosive of choice for clearing land.
<br>
...
<br>
To compensate for the diversion of fresh and value-added produce to the military, ordinary citizens began growing their own food. Victory gardens sprang up everywhere conditions permitted, and the result was that Americans relearned the value of a freshly picked ripe tomato. The war created another unintended agricultural opportunity, too. American supply convoys destined for the Pacific Theater of Operations encountered Japanese submarines, and the U.S. ships were sitting ducks. Huge quantities of supplies of all kinds were lost, including K rations. It’s not obvious who got the idea first, but many a commanding officer issued the order to establish hydroponic facilities on several of the captured islands. It is estimated that during the war, as much as eight thousand tons of fresh veggies were made available for Allied troops this way, helping to offset the losses suffered at sea. After the war, hydroponics was discarded, forgotten entirely, as America turned its attention to growing crops on the land that was to become the site of the greatest agricultural initiative on earth. The baby boomers were now in their early teens and more interested in going to college than in staying down on the family farm. Apparently, this had little effect on the restarting of the U.S. food “machine.” Despite all its attendant horrors, the war had proved advantageous in many respects, including supplying the right moment for the innovation needed to fully mechanize an entire country’s armed forces. One group in particular was outstanding in this respect: the Construction Battalions known to everyone as the “Seabees.” This naval group was highly decorated for its clever and efficient use of construction technologies. Using cutting-edge earth-moving machinery perfected during the early phases of the war, the Seabees rapidly adapted them to the efficient conversion of native jungle into barracks, and even small cities. They became particularly adept at remodeling even the most hostile terrain into flat airfields. After the war ended, these same methods were applied to land that before the war was considered highly unsuited for any kind of agriculture, easily transforming it into productive farmland using mammoth earth movers and massive tractors fitted with all kinds of front-loading devices. Farming was coming of age in the new industrial-military complex of postwar Europe and the United States. Good-bye wetlands, hello corn and cotton fields. In filling in many of the swamps in the American Southeast, we also got rid of malaria for good in this country.
<br>
If people are starving, and indeed they are, then it’s due entirely to issues related to maldistribution and mean-spirited politics, not actual crop shortages. That is largely because we have learned how to force every last radish, ear of corn, head of lettuce, strawberry, and everything else we grow from land that was never biologically able to do so without our help.
<br>
...
<br>
Every bit of today’s farming in the developed world is driven by technology. New kinds of farm equipment, new planting strategies, global-positioning systems for microcrop selection, and other high-tech approaches have extended the life of most soils far beyond their natural carrying capacity for producing, regardless of the crop in question. Research results from numerous graduate schools of agriculture throughout the world have led the way in changing what once was a hit-or-miss situation with regard to what and where we can farm into a predictable science of crop production. The agrochemical industries have been quick to adopt these new findings and have commercialized them to not only help the farmer but also to bolster their own profit margins. The Ag business is booming; fertilizer, herbicide, and pesticide product lines have become their bread and butter. No one denies the fact that these products have helped greatly in ushering in the second green revolution. Yield per acre for nearly every crop improves each year and will likely continue to do so for a few more years in many places. That is not to say that there are no problems looming on the near horizon, even for those fortunate countries with minimal environmental impact on their agricultural industries. But fossil fuels also figure into the equation. Higher yields are linked to increased fossil-fuel use by new farming machines. In the United States, more than 20 percent of all burned fuels goes to agriculture. The price of food is also linked to fossil-fuel use, and in 2008, the cost of food worldwide nearly doubled compared to the year 2000.

### Rachel Carson, Silent Spring
<p>
《침묵의 봄》(Silent Spring)은 1962년 레이철 카슨이 1차 세계대전 이후 미국에서 살포된 살충제나 제초제로 사용된 유독물질이 생태계에 미치는 영향을 분석하여 쓴 책으로, 환경운동이 서양에서 시작하게 되는 계기가 된 책이다. 이 책으로 인하여 1963년 미국의 케네디 대통령은 환경문제를 다룬 자문위원회를 구성하게 되었고, 1969년 미국의회는 DDT가 암을 유발할 수도 있다는 증거를 발표하였고, 1972년 미국 EPA(미 환경부)는 DDT의 사용을 금지하게 되었다.

이 책은 레이철 카슨이 《뉴요커》라는 잡지에 투고한 내용을 묶어서 책으로 편찬한 것이다. 이 책은 DDT나, BHC같은 유기염소계 농약에 대한 생물학적 피해를 설명해놓은 책으로서, 이런 "유독물질의 사용을 줄여야 된다"고 주장하고 있다. 이 책은 여러 가지 예시들을 통해서 이런 농약들이 우리 인체에 어떤 해를 주느냐, 그리고 자연에는 어떤 영향을 주는가에 대해서 설명해주고 있다. 이 책은 이런 농약들을 전혀 사용하지 않는 것이 아니라, 좀 더 자연적인 방법과, 자연에 폐를 끼치지 않는 쪽으로 방향을 바꿔야 된다고 주장하고 있다.
